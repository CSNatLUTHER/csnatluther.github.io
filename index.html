        <li>I work with senior leadership teams to analyze, plan and implement enterprise technology solutions across an organization.

    <ul>
        <li>I provided leadership and guidance to the organization to drive major technology initiatives in the disciplines of infrastructure, mobility, IoT, business intelligence and ERP. I managed a team of 12 employees to deliver the organization with IT strategic direction on all major initiatives. I also worked to develop the organizations first PMO and formalize their enterprise initiative selection process. Major projects during my employment period include an ERP data center move, two major IoT projects, BYOD infrastructure deployment, Cisco phone system upgrade, two Oracle Database upgrades, dozens of MS SQL database upgrades, a complete virtualization of self-hosted servers, Exchange upgrade, Oracle R12 ERP upgrade, Dynamic Routing software upgrade for distribution team and two data center consolidations.

During my tenure here, I oversaw and managed several major initiatives. One of the most significant efforts was a large IoT project that developed a mobile monitoring solution from the ground up. It was eventually installed in over 25,000 customer locations and is still in use today. This project designed and built a cellular enabled monitoring device that connected to several pieces of industrial equipment and sent back performance and current data for monitoring, pro-active service and marketing purposes. On the software side of this project, we developed a series of API, web services, administration management and customer portal solutions. There were also several reporting, analytics and business intelligence offerings developed for the purposes of continuous improvement and operational excellence.

Another significant project was an IoT and mobile application effort to connect the companies entire fleet of delivery vehicles to allow for real-time/dynamic routing, delivery and inventory management. The solution used connected devices on each truck to monitor the delivery and receipt of all inventory. It also developed software that runs on mobile smart phones that allows the driver to track, update and interact with tasks, management and colleagues during their shift. Finally, a backend reporting and administration solution was designed and developed to support the entire solution.</li>
